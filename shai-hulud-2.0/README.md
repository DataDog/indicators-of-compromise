## Indicators of compromise for the Shai Hulud 2.0 campaign

[shai-hulud-2.0.csv](shai-hulud-2.0.csv) contains a non-comprehensive list of npm packages that we have confirmed were backdoored in the Shai Hulud 2.0 campaign.

Format: one tuple (package_name, package_version) per line. If multiple versions of a single package were backdoored, each version appears on a separate line.
